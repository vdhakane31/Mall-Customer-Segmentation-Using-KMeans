# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-Using-KMeansThis project is part of **Task 2** of my **Machine Learning Internship**, where I implemented **K-Means clustering** to segment mall customers based on their purchasing behavior.

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer segmentation helps businesses understand different customer groups and design targeted marketing strategies.  
In this project, I applied **unsupervised learning** to cluster customers using features such as **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- K-Means Clustering
- Elbow Method to determine optimal number of clusters
- Feature Scaling for better clustering performance
- Data Visualization for cluster interpretation

## 📊 Results
- Identified **5 meaningful customer segments**, including:
  - VIP customers
  - Impulse buyers
  - High-income low-spending customers
  - Budget-conscious customers
- Visualized clusters to gain clear business insights

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I improved my understanding of:
- Unsupervised machine learning
- Data preprocessing and scaling
- Cluster evaluation techniques
- Using data insights for decision making

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
